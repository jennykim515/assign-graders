# assign-graders

1. Edit the filepath of the .csv file (i.e. example-course-staff.csv) to point to the exported csv files of the class roster for each section.
2. Change the constants at top of the main.py file

### Future Goals:

1. Automatically assign constants by parsing file header
2. Establish a naming convention for the class section .csv files and search a folder for each of the section .csv files (to prevent manual insertion of filepath data)
